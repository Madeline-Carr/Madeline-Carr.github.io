## What is it?

This project is meant to be an online portfolio where I can display my web development skills and progress. I am hoping to update it over time with new projects.

## Technologies I am Using

1. SASS

   - I used SASS for because it is quick to write and edit. I was primarily concerned with this because I wanted to be able to try different color schemes and designs quickly.

2. Google Maps API

   - I used the Google Maps API to show my location and then I edited the colors of the map to blend in with the background of my website.

3. CSS Grid

   - I used CSS Grid to create a simple but responsive layout that is easy to work with and will adapt when I add more content in the future.

4. Adobe Illustrator
   -I used Adobe Illustrator to make all the images for this page.
