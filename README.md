## What is it?

This project is meant to be an online portfolio where I can display my web development skills and progress. I am hoping to update it over time with new projects. 

## Technologies I am Using

1. SASS
    - I used SASS for because it is quick to write and edit. I was primarily concerned with this because I wanted to be able to try different color schemes and designs quickly. 

2. Google Maps API
    - I used the Google Maps API to show my location and then I edited the colors of the map to blend in with the background of my website.  
    
3. CSS Grid
    - I used CSS Grid to create a simple but responsive layout that is easy to work with and will adapt when I add more content in the future.
